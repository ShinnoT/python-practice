#personal notes
#input() is the same as gets.chomp in ruby
#must save input() in a variable


#ask user for name
name = input("What is your name?: ")
#ask user for age
age = int(input("What is your age?: "))
# print(type(age)) --> <class 'int'>
#ask user for city
city = input("Which city do you live in?: ")
#ask user what they enjoy
hobby = input("What do you enjoy doing in your free time?: ")
#create output text
output =
#print output to screen





#string concatination and interpolation in python
#A = "blah"
#B = "blob"
# A + B
# will return "blahblob"

#"="*5
#will return "====="

#however, cant add different types (it wont convert implicitly)
